# Proffy Mobile Version

## Introduction
Hello! This is the mobile version of the Proffy platform and my first React Native project! Feel free to use it and contribute! Please note that this is only the "front-end" of the application (I'm still studying how to unite with the server-side project and push them all here in GitHub). The goal of this project is to connect teachers and students.

## How does it work?
### If the user is a student
- The user touches the study button
