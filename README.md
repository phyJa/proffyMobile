# Proffy Mobile Version

## Project Idea
This application was developed following the instructions of [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat "Rocketseat github page"), during the Next Level Week #2 event. The idea was born as a __tribute to all educators__.

## Introduction
This is the mobile version of the [Proffy platform](https://github.com/phyJa/proffyWebPage "Web version repository") and my first React Native project! Feel free to use it and contribute! Please note that this is only the "front-end" of the application (I'm still studying how to unite with the server-side project and push them all here in GitHub). **The goal of this project is to connect teachers and students**. Take a look at its landing page:


> Landing page


<img
    class="landing"
    src="images/landing.png"
    alt="Landing page"
    width="50%"
/>
